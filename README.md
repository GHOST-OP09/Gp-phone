# Gp-phone
Phone for QB-Core Framework. Edited for a NP-Style look with a few extra things, This file has been edited with the changes noted


NOTE
NP does NOT have a suggested contact feature, therefore the tab for that in the Phone app has been removed. You can use /p# to show your number in chat in a small radius around you, or manually input the contacts.


Known Issues
if you call from a payphone without a cell phone there is no way to hang up the call. The other person has to hang up the call. After they do that then the phone UI is stuck on your screen
